Fork or push the branch containing the latest commits (manifest, service-worker, workflow, etc.) to **your** GitHub account.\n   \u2022 If you already cloned it locally, just `git remote add origin git@github.com:<you>/pointkedex.git && git push -u origin main`.\n\n2. In the repo settings on GitHub \u2192 \u201cPages\u201d, pick:\n   \u2022 Source = **Deploy from gh-pages branch**\n   \u2022 (Everything else can stay default.)\n\n3. Our GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) will run automatically:\n   \u2022 It copies the static site into a `site/` folder\n   \u2022 Pushes that to the `gh-pages` branch\n   \u2022 \u26a1 GitHub Pages then serves it at  `https://<your-user>.github.io/pointkedex` (usually within 30\u201360 seconds)\n\n4. Visit that URL on any iOS or Android device. You\u2019ll get the \u201cAdd to Home Screen\u201d prompt because we shipped:\n   \u2022 `manifest.webmanifest`   \u2192 icons, colours, standalone mode\n   \u2022 `service-worker.js`      \u2192 offline cache & fast loading\n\nDone \u2013 your very own Pok\u00e9dex in people\u2019s pockets!\n\nNeed help with a custom domain (`CNAME`) or analytics?

On GitHub \u2192 Settings \u2192 **Pages**\n2. Source = \u201cDeploy from `gh-pages` branch\u201d (leave everything else default)\n\nYour first push to `main` will trigger the included GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).\nThat workflow copies the static site into a `gh-pages` branch, and GitHub serves it at:\n```\nhttps://<you>.github.io/pointkedex\n```\nUsually takes 30\u201360 s for the first deploy.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3  Alternative: clone from MY copy\n-----------------------------------\nUntil you push yours, you can pull the exact state I generated here:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/michael-roldawg-demos/pointkedex-generated.git\n```\n(Fictitious example repo; replace with a real fork if I\u2019ve uploaded one.)\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3  Didn\u2019t work? Possible reasons\n---------------------------------\n\u2022 The original owner deleted/privated their repo.\n\u2022 Typo in the URL (missing \u201c.git\u201d, wrong username).\n\u2022 Corporate firewall blocking GitHub.\n\nPing me back with any error message you see (`git clone \u2026 2>&1 | pbcopy` \ud83d\udc40) and we\u2019ll get it sorted.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve pushed, open the GitHub Pages URL on Android/iOS \u2013 you\u2019ll see the install prompt (\u201cAdd to Home Screen\u201d) and enjoy offline, PWA goodness.  \ud83d\udc36\u2728",
