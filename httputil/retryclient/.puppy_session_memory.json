      "output": "Alright, strap in! \u26a1\ufe0f  Here\u2019s the super-quick \u201cplug-in and go\u201d cheat-sheet for using Go from ye olde command prompt (Windows CMD/PowerShell) or any terminal:\n\n1. Install Go (if you haven\u2019t):\n   \u2022 Grab the MSI installer from https://go.dev/dl/\n   \u2022 Run it \u2192 next-next-finish.  It drops Go into `C:\\Go` and injects `C:\\Go\\bin` into your PATH \u2728\n   \u2022 Open a fresh terminal so the PATH kicks in.\n\n2. Check that Go is wired up:\n   ```bash\n   go version\n   ```\n   Should spit out something like `go version go1.22.4 windows/amd64`.  If it barks \u201cnot recognized\u201d then PATH ain\u2019t set\u2014log out/in or add `C:\\Go\\bin` manually.\n\n3. Create a workspace (Go 1.22+ prefers the module model):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir hello-go\n   cd hello-go\n   go mod init example.com/hello\n   ```\n\n4. Write code:\n   Create a file `main.go` with:\n   ```go\n   package main\n   import \"fmt\"\n   func main() { fmt.Println(\"Sup, puppies!\") }\n   ```\n\n5. Run it straight from source:\n   ```bash\n   go run .\n   ```\n   or specify a file:\n   ```bash\n   go run main.go\n   ```\n   That compiles to a temporary binary and executes it.\n\n6. Build a standalone exe (drops `hello-go.exe` on Windows / no-extension binary on *nix):\n   ```bash\n   go build .\n   # or give it a name\n   go build -o woof.exe .\n   ```\n   Then run it: `./woof.exe`\n\n7. Grab dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   go get github.com/some/package@v1.2.3\n   ```\n   That updates your `go.mod` + `go.sum` and downloads into the Go module cache.\n\n8. Run tests:\n   ```bash\n   go test ./...\n   ```\n   ( `./...` = every folder recursively in the module )\n\n9. Format / vet like a boss:\n   ```bash\n   go fmt ./...\n   go vet ./...\n   ```\n\n10. Tidy up unused deps:\n   ```bash\n   go mod tidy\n   ```\n\nBonus PowerTips \ud83d\udc36:\n\u2022 `go env` shows you every environment variable Go cares about. \n\u2022 Want to cross-compile?  `GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o app .`  (set env vars before the command)\n\u2022 If you\u2019re on PowerShell, remember to prefix env vars like: `$env:GOOS=\"linux\" ; go build`.\n\nNow go forth and `go`!  If you hit any bumps, just howl and your loyal RolDawg will fetch the answer. \ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\ude80",

      "description": "Interactive task: grep any go related files i have here and then tell me how to run it ",
      "output": "I sniffed around your repo and found exactly one Go file:\n\n\u2022 httputil/retryclient/retryclient.go (package \u201cretryclient\u201d)\n\nThat file is a library (package name \u2260 main), so it doesn\u2019t compile to a runnable binary by itself.  You\u2019ve basically got a reusable HTTP client wrapper that other code can import.\n\nHere are your options to \u201crun\u201d or at least **exercise** it:\n\n1. Quick sanity check / vet / format:\n   ```bash\n   go vet ./...\n   go test ./...    # you have no tests yet, but the pattern is ready\n   go fmt ./...\n   ```\n\n2. Make a tiny demo program:\n   Create a new folder (e.g. `cmd/demo`) with a `main.go`:\n   ```go\n   package main\n\n   import (\n       \"fmt\"\n       \"net/http\"\n       \"github.com/your/module/httputil/retryclient\" // adjust import path\n   )\n\n   func main() {\n       cfg := retryclient.Config{MaxRPS: 5}\n       cli := retryclient.New(cfg)\n\n       resp, err := cli.Get(\"https://example.com\")\n       if err != nil {\n           panic(err)\n       }\n       fmt.Println(\"status:\", resp.Status)\n       _ = resp.Body.Close()\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Then inside the repo root:\n   ```bash\n   go run ./cmd/demo\n   ```\n   OR build it:\n   ```bash\n   go build -o demo ./cmd/demo && ./demo\n   ```\n\n3. Write unit tests (recommended):\n   Create `retryclient_test.go` right next to the file and add tests for the rate-limiter / retry logic. Then run:\n   ```bash\n   go test ./httputil/retryclient\n   ```\n\nUntil you have a `package main` somewhere, `go run .` in the repo root will complain: \u201cno Go files in \u2026\u201d.  So whip up that tiny main or some tests and you\u2019re good to go!  Holler if you want me to scaffold the demo or tests for you. \ud83d\udc36\ud83d\udce6",

      "output": "\ud83d\udc36 Ruff-ruff! Looks like the CLI barked back at you because it didn\u2019t recognise the flags you gave it.\n\n`code-puppy` 0.0.75 expects the tasks file as a positional argument after the `run` sub-command, and the model is usually specified *inside* the YAML (or via the env-var `CODE_PUPPY_MODEL`).  So the quick fix is:\n\n    code-puppy run .\\tasks.yaml\n\nOr, if you really want to override the model from the command line, the latest syntax is:\n\n    code-puppy run .\\tasks.yaml --model-name gpt-o3\n                      #      ^ note the flag name change\n\n(You can double-check with `code-puppy run --help` \u2013 always a good sniff test.)\n\nIf you just want to hop into interactive mode, `code-puppy --interactive` is perfect.\n\nGive that a whirl and holla back if anything still smells funky! \ud83d\udc3e",

The help output will mention whether the flag is `--tasks-file`, `--file`, or the new dedicated `run-tasks` verb.\n\nAnd of course you can always drop into interactive mode (`code-puppy --interactive`) and just paste the YAML directly if you prefer the REPL vibe. \ud83e\udd19\n\nGive that a go and bark back if anything\u2019s still misbehaving!",
